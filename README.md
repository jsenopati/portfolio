## Hello!

This is my tiny portfolio site. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Feel free to visit the deployed [page](https://jsenopati.dev/), where you'll find some projects I've worked on and other information about me, including my resume and contact details.
